###You might need to first remove the nvhpc@=23.9 compiler section from the above file and add it back after the install step below
spack install
despacktivate
####Add the location of nvhpc23.9 compilers to spack.yaml if you removed it
spack env activate -p nvhpc239
which nvfortran

- Build and Install hdf5/netcdf using the new nvhpc compiler (you might want to do this in 3 steps hdf5,netcdf-c,netcdf-f if the whole script gives you trouble):
